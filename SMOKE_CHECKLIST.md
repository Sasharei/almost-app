# Smoke Checklist

- Launch app -> splash completes -> home renders without errors.
- Feed loads and scrolls; open/close history modal.
- Add a custom temptation below 150 -> appears in feed.
- At 150+ custom temptations: adding shows a warning but still opens the creator.
- At 200 custom temptations: adding shows a limit alert and does not create a new item.
- A temptation with a frequency shows a countdown that updates over time.
- Text and text inputs render with Inter fonts.
- Orientation stays portrait on phone/tablet builds.
